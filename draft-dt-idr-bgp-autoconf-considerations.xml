		<t>The auto-discovery mechanism is designed to be simple.</t>
		<t>The goal is to select BGP Speakers where a BGP session may be

		exchanged by the BGP FSM, including its OPEN message.</t>

			<t>Device roles are the minimal information available
			for peer selection for a particular application.  While
			some roles may be standardized to provide consistent
			code points, the expectation is that roles will in many

            "I'm at Layer (stage) 3 in the Clos fabric", "I'm a fabric egress
            node", etc.</t>
			<t>Once this information has been learned, a BGP Speaker

		<t>Implementations supporting more than one transport protocol

            <t>With BGP auto-discovery, some configuration of BGP is still
            needed. Operator configuration should be able to decide at least
            the following:
            <list style="symbols">
                <t>Select or otherwise filter which peers to actually try to
                send BGP OPEN message.</t>
                <t>Decide the parameters to use, for example:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>IP addressing: IPv4 or IPv6</t>
                    <t>Interface for peering: Loopback, or Direct</t>
                    <t>Any special forwarding or routing needed for reaching
                    the prospective peer, for example, loopback.</t>

            <t>In addition to actually forming the BGP sessions, a common
            deplyoment model may also the so called "validation" model. In this
            model, the operator configures the BGP sessions manually, and uses
            the information collected/populated by the BGP Autoconf mechanism
            to validate that the sessions are correct.</t>

        <section title="Analysis of Candidate Approaches">
            <section title="BGP Peer Discovery at Layer Two">
                <t>BGP Discovery at Layer-2 would entail finding potential
                peers on a LAN or on Point-to-Point links, discovering their
                Layer-3 attributes such as IP addresses, etc.</t>
                <t>There are two available candidates for peer discovery at
                Layer-2, one is based on Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP),
                the other one is based on Layer 3 Discovery Protocol, L3DL
                <xref target="I-D.ietf-lsvr-l3dl" />.</t>
                <section title="LLDP based Approach">
                    <t>LLDP is a widely deployed protocol with implementations
                    in most devices in data centers. Currently it does not
                    reveal Layer-3 information such as IP addresses.

                    <xref target="I-D.ietf-lsvr-l3dl" /> is an ongoing
                    development in the IETF LSVR Working Group with the goals
                    of discovering IP Layer-3 attributes of links, such as
                    neighbor IP addressing, logical link IP encapsulation
                    abilities, and link liveness which may then be disseminated
                    for the use of BGP-SPF and similar protocols.</t>

                    signaling the minimal set of parameters needed to start a
                    BGP session with a discovered peer. Details such as
                    loopback peering are handled by attributes in the L3DL
                    protocol itself. The information which can be discovered by
                    L3DL is
                    <list style="symbols">
                        <t>AS number</t>
                        <t>Local IP address, IPv4 or IPv6, and</t>
                        <t>BGP Authentication.</t>
                    </list></t>
                    <t>L3DL and L3DL-ULPC have well-specified security
                    mechanisms, see
                    <xref target="I-D.ietf-lsvr-l3dl-signing" />.</t>
                    <t>The functionality of L3DL-ULPC is similar but not quite
                    the same as the needs of IDR Design Team. E.g., L3DL is
                    designed to meet more complex needs. L3DL's predecessor,
                    LSOE
                    <xref target="I-D.ietf-lsvr-lsoe" />, was simpler and might
                    be a better candidate for adaptation. If needed the design
                    of LSOE may be customized for the needs of BGP peer auto-
                    disovery.</t>
                    <t>Unlike LLDP, L3DL has only one implementation, and LSOE
                    has only one open source implementation, and neither is
                    significantly deployed.</t>

        <section title="BGP peer Discovery at Layer Three">
            <t>Discovery at Layer-3 can assume IP addressability, though the IP
            addresses of potential peers are not known a priori and need to be
            discovered before further negotiation. IP multicast may be a good
            choice to address the above concern.</t>
            <t>The possible problem would appear to discovery at Layer-3 is
            that one may not know whether to use IPv4 or IPv6.  This might be
            exacerbated by the possibility of a potential peer not being on the
            local subnet, and hence broadcast and similar techniques may not be
            applicable. While in data center network or networks in a single
            administrative domain, such issue could be easily solved.</t>
            <t>If one can assume that the BGP session is based on
            point-to-point link, then discovery might try IPv6 link-local or
            even IPv4 link- local. A link broadcast or multicast protocol may
            also be used. For switched or bridged multi-point which is at least
            on the same subnet, VLAN, etc., multicast or broadcasts might be a
            viable approach.</t>
            <t>There are two available candidates for BGP peer discovery at
            Layer-3, one is based on extending BGP with new Hello message for
            peer auto- discovery, the other one is based on reusing BGP OPEN
            message format for peer auto-discovery.</t>
            <section title="New BGP Hello Message based Approach">
                <t>
                <xref target="I-D.xu-idr-neighbor-autodiscovery" /> describes a
                BGP neighbor discovery mechanism which is based on a newly
                defined UDP based BGP Hello message. The BGP Hello message is
                sent in multicast to discover the directly connected BGP peers.
                According to the message header format and the TLVs carried in
                the message, the information which can be signaled is:
                <list style="symbols">

		<!-- XXX JMH - draft raszuk auto-discovery covered by patent -->
                <xref target="I-D.raszuk-idr-bgp-auto-session-setup" /> describes
                a BGP neighbor discovery mechanism by reusing BGP OPEN message
                format with newly defined UDP port. The message is called BGP
                Session Explorer (BSE) packet and is sent in multicast. Since
                the message format is the same as BGP OPEN, the information
                which can be signaled is:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>AS number</t>
                    <t>BGP Identifier</t>
                    <t>Peering address</t>
                </list></t>

	    <section title="Bootstrapping BGP via BGP">
		<t>
		<xref target="I-D.raszuk-idr-bgp-auto-discovery"/> describes a
		new BGP address family.  The NLRI carries a Group ID + BGP
		Identifier as the key.  A new BGP Path Attribute carries
		information about the sessions:
		<list style="symbols">
		    <t>AS Number</t>
		    <t>AFI/SAFI</t>
		    <t>BGP Identifier</t>
		    <t>Peer Transport Address</t>
		    <t>Flags to declare a session for information only, to force
		    a reset of a session on parameter changes, etc.</t>

            <section title="Discovery at Layer Seven">
                <t>Peer discovery at Layer-7 requires application layer
                rendezvous mechanisms analogous to those used by LISP,
                <xref target="RFC6830" /> or the Bitcoin Protocol.</t>
                <t>If the infrastructure is at all complex, for example, multi-segment
                or worse, then it will need prior routing/forwarding knowledge
                in order to reach the rendezvous. In a BGP centric deployment
                this could pose a chicken and egg problem.</t>
                <t>Rendezvous approaches may appeal to deployments which favor
                a central control framework.</t>
                <t>On the other hand, those who favor distributed protocols
                will have the classic worries about fragility, redundancy,
                reliability, etc.</t>
