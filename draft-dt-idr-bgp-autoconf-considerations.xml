	    <t>
   This draft is an exploration of the requirements, the alternatives
   and trade-offs in BGP peer auto-discovery at various layers in the
   stack.  It is based on discussions in the IDR WG BGP Autoconf Design
   Team.  The current target environment is the datacenter, while it is
   considered by the design team to not to preclude the analysis of WAN
   deployment in the future.
	    </t>
</section>

<section title="Backgrounds and Requirements">
<t>
   Previous discussion in BGP autoconf design team converged on a number
   of aspects of the BGP auto-configuration problem.
</t>

<section title="The Scope">
<t>
   The current target environment has BGP used as the underlay routing
   protocol in data center network.  While it is also considered by the
   design team to not to preclude the work on WAN in future.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Assumptions">
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
BGP OPEN message will do the heavy lifting in BGP session
establishment.
</t>

<t>
Before BGP OPEN message is sent, there is BGP auto-discovery and
there is choosing peers.
</t>

<t>
BGP auto-discovery should not do anything that could be done by
BGP OPEN message.
</t>

<t>
BGP peering could be selective, every BGP speaker may not want to
peer with every other BGP speaker.
</t>

<t>
BGP speakers does not know the potential peers' IP addresses and
AS number.
</t>

<t>
After BGP auto-discovery, it would be nice if another exchange was
not needed before BGP OPEN.
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Summary of Requirements">
<t>
   The set of requirements that have been agreed by the design team are
   as follows:

<list style="symbols">
<t>
Support IPv4 and IPv6 address families, but do not assume both are
available.
</t>

<t>
Support discovery of the peering IP addresses for the BGP session
endpoints.
</t>

<t>
Support using either a device's interface address or one of its
loopback addresses for the BGP session endpoint.
</t>

<t>
Support discovery of the peers' ASs.
</t>

<t>
Support discovery of the set of possible peers, and optionally
each one's attributes, which can be a deployment defined set,
e.g.: leaf, spine, ice cream flavor, etc.  These attributes are
arbitrary and operator dependent.  No assumptions about this
should be made, code points assigned,, etc.
</t>

<t>
Support to agree on any BGP session authentication and parameters.
</t>

<t>
Support to enable Layer 3 link liveness detection, such as BFD.
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Simplicity">
<t>
   The goal is to provide the minimal set of configuration parameters
   needed by BGP OPEN to successfully start a BGP peering.  The goal is
   specifically not to replace or conflict with data exchanged during
   BGP OPEN.  Multiple sources of truth are a recipe for complexity and
   hence painful errors.
</t>

<t>
   Simplicity is the key.  Features not absolutely needed will not be
   included in the design.  While the mechanism also needs some
   scalability for information which may be proved necessary in the
   future.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Operator Configuration">
<t>
   With BGP auto-discovery, some configuration of BGP is still needed.
   Operator configuration should be able to decide at least the
   following:

<list style="symbols">
<t>
Select or otherwise filter which peers to actually try to send BGP
OPEN message.
</t>

<t>
Decide the parameters to use, e.g.:

<list style="symbols">

<t>
IP addressing: IPv4 or IPv6
</t>

<t>
Interface for peerig: Loopback, or Direct
</t>

<t>
Any special forwarding or routing needed for reaching the
prospective peer, e.g., loopback.
</t>

<t>
AS numbering.
</t>

<t>
BGP Authentication Options.
</t>
</list>
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Considerations on Design Principles">
<t>
   This section summarizes the considerations of possible criteria for
   the design of BGP auto-discovery mechanism, which may need further
   discussion in a wider community than the design team (e.g. the IDR
   WG).
</t>

<t>
   The network layer of the discovery mechanism:

  <list style="symbols">

    <t> Layer 2: e.g. based on ethernet </t>

    <t> Layer 3: which is generic for any link-layer protocol </t>
  </list>
</t>

  <t>
   Relationship with BGP:

  <list style="symbols">
    <t> Independent from BGP session establishment </t>

    <t> Not affect on BGP session establishment and routing exchange,
    other than the interactions for triggering the setup/removal of
    peer session based on discovery mechanism </t>

    <t> Make use of existing BGP protocol for automating the BGP session
    bring-up </t>
  </list>

</t>

<t>
   Other criteria:
<list style="symbols">
<t> Make use of a currently implemented and deployed protocol in data
center.  </t>

<t> Widely applicable to a range of routing and similar protocols
which need layer 3 discovery and characterization </t>

<t> Length of the message size supported </t> 
<t> Extensibility </t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Analysis to Candidate Approaches">
<section title="BGP Peer Discovery at Layer Two">

<t>
   BGP Discovery at Layer-2 would entail finding potential peers on a
   LAN or on Point-to-Point links, discovering their Layer-3 attributes
   such as IP addresses, etc.
</t>

<t>
   There are two available candidates for peer discovery at Layer-2, one
   is based on Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), the other one is
   based on Layer 3 Discovery Protocol, L3DL <xref target="I-D.ietf-lsvr-l3dl"/>.
</t>

<section title="LLDP based Approach">
<t>
   LLDP is a widely deployed protocol with implementations in most
   devices in data center.  Currently it does not reveal Layer-3
   information such as IP addresses.  LLDP has a limitation of single
   PDU size.  There is an early LLDPv2 development to extend this in
   IEEE.
</t>

<t>
   <xref target="I-D.acee-idr-lldp-peer-discovery"/> describes how to use the LLDP IETF
   Organizationally Specific TLV to augment the LLDP TLV set to exchange
   BGP Config Sub-TLVs signaling:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
AFI
</t> 
<t>
IP address (IPv4 or IPv6)
</t>

<t>
Local AS number
</t>

<t>
Local BGP Identifier (AKA, BGP Router ID)
</t>

<t>
Session Group-ID
</t>

<t>
BGP Session Capabilities
</t>

<t>
Key Chain
</t>

<t>
Local Address (as BGP Next Hop).
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
   Which of these are really necessary could be discussed.
</t>
</section>

<section title="L3DL based Approach">
<t>
   L3DL <xref target="I-D.ietf-lsvr-l3dl"/> is an ongoing development in the IETF LSVR
   Working Group with the goals of discovering IP Layer-3 attributes of
   links, such as neighbor IP addressing, logical link IP encapsulation
   abilities, and link liveness which may then be disseminated for the
   use of BGP-SPF and similar protocols.
</t>

<t>
   L3DL Upper Layer Protocol Configuration, <xref target="I-D.ietf-lsvr-l3dl-ulpc"/>,
   details signaling the minimal set of parameters needed to start a BGP
   session with a discovered peer.  Details such as loopback peering are
   handled by attributes in the L3DL protocol itself.  The information
   which can be discovered by L3DL is
<list style="symbols">
<t>
AS number
</t>

<t>
Local IP address, IPv4 or IPv6, and
</t>

<t>
BGP Authentication.
</t>
</list>

</t>

<t>
   L3DL and L3DL-ULPC have well-specified security mechanisms, see
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-lsvr-l3dl-signing"/>.
</t>

<t>
   The functionality of L3DL-ULPC is similar but not quite the same as
   the needs of IDR Design Team.  E.g., L3DL is designed to meet more
   complex needs.  L3DL's predecessor, LSOE <xref target="I-D.ietf-lsvr-lsoe"/>, was
   simpler and might be a better candidate for adaptation.  If needed
   the design of LSOE may be customized for the needs of BGP peer auto-
   disovery.
</t>

<t>
   Unlike LLDP, L3DL has only one implementation, and LSOE has only one
   open source implementation, and neither is significantly deployed.
</t>
</section>
</section>
</section>

<section title="BGP peer Discovery at Layer Three">
<t>
   Discovery at Layer-3 can assume IP addressability, though the IP
   addresses of potential peers are not known a priori and need to be
   discovered before further negotiation.IP multicast may be a good
   choice to address the above concern.
</t>

<t>
   The possible problem would appear to discovery at Layer-3 is that one
   may not know whether to use IPv4 or IPv6.  This might be exacerbated
   by the possibility of a potential peer not being on the local subnet,
   and hence broadcast and similar techniques may not be applicable.
   While in data center network or networks in a single administrative
   domain, such issue could be easily solved.
</t>

<t>
   If one can assume that the BGP session is based on point-to-point
   link, then discovery might try IPv6 link-local or even IPv4 link-
   local.  A link broadcast or multicast protocol may also be used.  For
   switched or bridged multi-point which is at least on the same subnet,
   VLAN, etc., multicast or broadcasts might be a viable approach.
</t>

<t>
   There are two available candidates for BGP peer discovery at Layer-3,
   one is based on extending BGP with new Hello message for peer auto-
   discovery, the other one is based on reusing BGP OPEN message format
   for peer auto-discovery.
</t>

<section title="New BGP Hello Message based Approach">
<t>
   <xref target="I-D.xu-idr-neighbor-autodiscovery"/> describes a BGP neighbor
   discovery mechanism which is based on a newly defined UDP based BGP
   Hello message.  The BGP Hello message is sent in multicast to
   discover the directly connected BGP peers.  According to the message
   header format and the TLVs carried in the message, the information
   which can be signaled is:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
AS number
</t>

<t>
BGP Identifier
</t>

<t>
Accepted ASN list
</t>

<t>
Peering address (IPv4 or IPv6)
</t>

<t>
Local prefix (for loopback)
</t>

<t>
Link attributes
</t>

<t>
Neighbor state
</t>

<t>
BGP Authentication
</t>

</list>

   Which of these are really necessary could be discussed.

</t>
</section>
<section title="BGP OPEN Message based Approach">
<t>
   <xref target="I-D.raszuk-idr-bgp-auto-session-setup"/> describes a BGP neighbor
   discovery mechanism by reusing BGP OPEN message format with newly
   defined UDP port.  The message is called BGP Session Explorer (BSE)
   packet and is sent in multicast.  Since the message format is the
   same as BGP OPEN, the information which can be signaled is:

<list style="symbols">
<t>
AS number
</t>

<t>
BGP Identifier
</t>

<t>
Peering address
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Discovery at Layer Seven">
<t>
   Peer discovery at Layer-7 requires application layer rendezvous
   mechanisms analogous to those used by LISP, <xref target="RFC6830"/> or the Bitcoin
   Protocol.
</t>

<t>
   If the infrastructure is at all complex, e.g. multi-segment or worse,
   then it will need prior routing/forwarding knowledge in order to
   reach the rendezvous.  In a BGP centric deployment this could pose a
   chicken and egg problem.
</t>

<t>
   Rendezvous approaches may appeal to deployments which favor a central
   control framework.
</t>

<t>
   On the other hand, those who favor distributed protocols will have
   the classic worries about fragility, redundancy, reliability, etc.
